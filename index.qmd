title: "Improving your chances for a successful startup"
---

## **Introduction**

This app aims to provide a comprehensive visualisation of certain characteristics and trends of unicorn startup companies. It has the potential to reveal and inform on favourable conditions that may increase the potential of producing a unicorn.

### **Data Set**

This app makes use of 2 datasets, namely 'List of unicorn startup companies' and 'Number of startups by country'. The idea behind the selection of these 2 datasets is to perform a comparative analysis between the 2 sets, to not just visualise successful countries and industries, but to determine the rate of unicorns based on the number of total startups in a country.
