title: "Driving the rise of Unicorn Startups"
---

### **Introduction**

I am Jiaxian, a student at the National University of Singapore. This app serves to demonstrate various topics learned from this R course and aims to provide a comprehensive visualisation of certain characteristics and trends of unicorn startup companies. It has the potential to reveal and inform on favourable conditions that may increase the potential of producing a unicorn.

#### **Data Set**

This app makes use of 2 datasets, namely 'List of unicorn startup companies' and 'Number of startups by country'. The idea behind the selection of these 2 datasets is to perform a comparative analysis between the 2 sets, not just to visualise successful countries and industries, but to determine the rate of unicorns based on the number of total startups in a country.

Grab, Lazada, and Carousell. What do these have in common?

Apart from being part of our everyday vocabulary, they are also some of Singapore's most successful Unicorn Startups to date. Unicorns, not mythical creatures in folklore, but a rare breed of of startup companies that have taken the world by storm. In the realm of business, unicorns are startups that achieved an elusive status: a valuation of \$1 billion or more, making them extremely sought-after entities.

Given the rarity of this phenomenon, it is expectedly tough for business owners to achieve such status. Within the company, you must be able to run a tight ship and operate on novel ideas, but externally, several factors could make or break your chances before you even set out. Here, we take a look at the environmental factors surrounding some of the most successful unicorns in the world and see how factors such as geographical placement and industry trends can help you better position your startup.
