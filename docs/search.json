    "text": "Introduction\nHi, I am Jiaxian, a student from NUS. This app serves to demonstrate various topics learned from this R course and aims to provide a comprehensive visualisation of certain characteristics and trends of unicorn startup companies. It has the potential to reveal and inform on favourable conditions that may increase the potential of producing a unicorn.\n\nData Set\nThis app makes use of 2 datasets, namely ‘List of unicorn startup companies’ and ‘Number of startups by country’. The idea behind the selection of these 2 datasets is to perform a comparative analysis between the 2 sets, not just to visualise successful countries and industries, but to reveal findings such as the rate of unicorns based on the number of total startups in a country.\n\n\n\nWhat makes a unicorn?\nGrab, Lazada, and Carousell. What do these have in common?\nApart from being part of our everyday vocabulary, they are also some of Singapore’s most successful Unicorn Startups to date. Unicorns, not mythical creatures in folklore, but a rare breed of of startup companies that have taken the world by storm. In the realm of business, unicorns are startups that achieved an elusive status: a valuation of $1 billion or more, making them extremely sought-after entities.\nGiven the rarity of this phenomenon, it is expectedly tough for business owners to achieve such status. Within the company, you must be able to run a tight ship and operate on novel ideas, but externally, several factors could make or break your chances before you even set out. Here, we take a look at the environmental factors surrounding some of the most successful unicorns in the world and see how factors such as geographical placement and industry trends can help you better position your startup.\n \n\n\nRate of Unicorns by Country\nToday, unicorns can be found globally, a stark contrast to a decade or two ago when the majority of them were founded in the United States. Looking at the number of startups by country, it is clear that the United States, China, and India take the lead on the volume of startups founded. This indicates a supportive startup ecosystem in such countries, where the bulk of startups are headquartered in cities such as California, Shanghai, and Bengaluru. There is no question about operating in one of these ‘Silicon Valleys’, where innovation and funding are much easier to come by. However, although these are certainly popular, such cities are not the only regions where startups can find success.\nWhat is more intriguing and possibly more important, is the rate of emergence of unicorns in countries such as China, South Korea, and Israel. Combined, the startups founded in the 3 countries are only a fraction of the number located in the United States, but boast much higher success rates of unicorns, with China sporting an unbelievable 1 in 4 unicorns.\nA reliable and supportive ecosystem is needed to find success for your business, but instead of only looking towards popular cities in the US or India, less competitive but viable options can be seen in places like China and South Korea.\n\n\nWhat do they do?\nAnother factor that would affect the success of startups would be industry trends. We can refer to the donut charts for a better understanding of which industry dominates the unicorn landscape.\nEnterprise Technologies leads the pack with 30.3% of unicorns under the sector, followed closely by Finance, Retail, and Industrials at 17.7, 17.6, and 15.6% share respectively. Valuation-wise, the data shows that the proportion of companies more or less equals the valuation of each sector. The one outlier is in Media with a 6.63% share of companies, but taking a 13% share in valuation. This is the result of ByteDance, the highest-valued unicorn in the world, coming in at USD$225 Billion.\nAlthough there is no definitive answer to which is the correct industry choice for your startup to make money, this donut chart may give further insights into which sectors are more reliable, or perhaps even identify which sectors may have a gap in the market.\n\n\nRecent Trends\nLooking more closely into industry trends, the provided bubble chart organises each unicorn by its valuation date and industry, with the bubble size corresponding to the valuation amount.\nStartup unicorns only began appearing en masse from around 2017, with a record number seen in 2021. In the past 5 years, Enterprise and Finance have measured great successes in both volume and valuation. However, the remaining sectors appear to be slowing down, with fewer unicorns and lower valuations since 2022."
